&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the value and importance of hard work. I have worked consistently since my first job, at age 15 at a movie theatre. I have worked retail most of my life. When I moved to Missouri, 8 years ago, I decided that wasn’t something I was willing to do for the rest of my life. I decided to go back to school. I started my college journey focusing on computer networking. But, after I got my Associate Degree, I found something that changed my mind. That something was computer programming. With this profession, I could take my love of art and 3D animation and create something I am passionate about. When I start writing and testing code, I go to a whole different world, where time just flies by. Computer programming is not just a career goal for me, but one of the loves of my life. I am very grateful that I can do it for a living. My goal, eventually, is to create computer programs that will make this world a little bit brighter. I think technology, when used correctly, can be used to help all of society. We have the power, is the time to do something with it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways… My journey began in Aurora, Colorado back in 1986 when I first came into this world. At a few months old, I was moved to where I was raised until I was 25; Cheyenne, Wyoming. I was always a very curious child, who didn’t mind playing alone. But I guess that is expected when my closest sibling was 10 years older than me. I have always enjoyed computers, but I didn’t get my first computer until I was about 13 years old. I still remember the day I got it; it was a game changer. After that, I would build computers, take them apart to fix them, and of course play some computer games with my friends. In Junior High I was also lucky enough to take some classes on architectural drafting in AutoCAD as well as some 3D animation classes in 3Ds Max. This is when my true desire for computers to be part of my future started to develop. I have always loved art. When I saw I could transfer that love over to the world of computers, it planted a seed that would come out in my later years.

This beautiful lady is my wife Cheyenne. Her parents named her after my hometown, so I think it was meant to be. She is a wonderful mother, full time employee at a hospital in town and does a lot of great volunteer work for our community. She is even the 2018 Missouri Jobs with Justice Workers’ Voice Award recipient for all the hard work she has done, and I couldn’t be prouder of her!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are my wonderful children who have turned my life around for the better. From left to right we have Mason (5), Amara (2) and Landon (10). Shortly after my daughter was born, Landon was diagnosed with Severe Aplastic Anemia, and ultimately needed a bone marrow transplant. Amara spent the better part of her first year in the hospital with my wife and Landon. Our family had to be split up while we worked through these difficult circumstances. Everyone is better now, and we are a stronger family for it. Going through something like this makes you want to stand up and fight for those you love. I am hoping we all take the cards we are dealt and make the best of the life we have been given. Just remember, circumstances could always be worse. The people in your life make a difference, so be someone worth looking up to.
