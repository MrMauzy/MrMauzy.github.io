<h1 align="center">Machine Learning Part One</h1> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a while now I have wanted to be a Software Developer but with my Computer Science degree under my belt I am starting to change my mind on what field I would like to venture into. I don’t see anything wrong with the Software Developer career path, but I found something that has really started to peak my interests. I could spend days (happily) learning about all the different ways technology is changing our lives but I don’t want to be a ship lost in the middle of the ocean, going wherever the wind takes it. I want to drop my anchor and dig deep with a focus and after many hours of online searches, tutorials and articles read I have particularly been interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. So, I am going to use this blog to record my findings and write about things I find interesting. This is not meant to be a learning guide or anything like that, this is simply me recording and getting out things that I come across in my journey.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, with that said I am going to start at the beginning and work my way deep into the rabbit hole. Whenever you look up Machine Learning you come across two terms, Supervised Machine Learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning and in this blog, I would like to talk about those two terms.  

<h1 align="center">Supervised Machine Learning</h1> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach to machine learning reminds me of when I teach my children math (my second favorite subject). We take a group of inputs and we know what the outputs should be, and we are trying to get the machine, or child, to give us the correct output by only giving them the inputs. Another example of this would be taking a group of fruits and vegetables with different characteristics such as color, type of seeds, grown above or below ground, and then using a Machine Learning Algorithm to tell us what category each new item should fall into, either fruits or vegetables. Before we get an answer though we must give the machine some examples to work with and the more examples we give it the better the categorization we will get (in theory). This would fall into the classification section of supervised machine learning because it gives us a category as an output. There is also something called a regression model that is very similar to classification except it gives the output as a real value such as dollars or height. An example of this could be where we enter different information about houses such as square feet, the general location and the number of bedrooms and the program then tries to give us an accurate value of the home.  

<h1 align="center">Unsupervised Machine Learning</h1> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of Machine Learning is the most interesting to me. Here we take a set of inputs with no corresponding outputs, such as a random selection of student’s GPA’s and how many hours they read a week. The goal of this model is to find the underlying structure or distribution of the data to learn more about it. This is called unsupervised because there is no right or wrong answer. Whatever algorithm is used will take the data and either cluster it, meaning that it will group the data such as customers and the type of shows they like to watch so they know what to recommend. Or it will group them by association where it can discover rules that can relate to large portions of your data. Such as when person X buys a product they are more likely to buy Y.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a very basic break down of two types of machine learning and I am hoping as the weeks progress to dig deeper to grow my knowledge in this field. I get excited when I learn a new topic and I hope as a reader you can at least get something out of my ramblings and I hope you come back. This blog will be used to keep me growing and learning because you know what they say, ‘if you aren’t growing you are dying!’
