## Hello there, my name is Matt Mauzy and I am Computer Science Graduate based in Springfield, Missouri.  
## I love creating art from 3D Animation to hand drawing cartoons, there is also a special place in my heart for mathematics, especially math used in games.  
## I fell in love with software development and I hope you stick around and see what I have made. This isnâ€™t just a career choice for me, it is a passion.

### What are you looking at? 

What you happen to be looking at is my portfolio, this showcases the skills I have acquired though my journey into software development and the passion that I put into this field of study. Throughout my degree I have worked on many different projects and I have selected a few to put into my portfolio. I tried to stick with some core Computer Science topics such as Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases and that will grow as time goes on. This work exemplifies a broad scope of what I have learned in my degree and I would like to go over how these projects have made me a more well-rounded software developer.
