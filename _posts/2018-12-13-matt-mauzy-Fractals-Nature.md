Now, I would love to talk to you about fractals that are found in nature and why I find them so interesting. Most people think of fractals 
as cool designs on album covers or famous artwork, but it is so much more. I love any kind of math that you can apply and see in the world 
around you and fractals is one that makes it easy for us. Fractals are basically a never-ending pattern that looks the same if you zoom in 
or out of the object in question. Here is a picture of an example.

These designs are created by duplicating the same simple pattern over and over and these patterns are seen all over nature. These designs 
look very complicated but, it is driven by simplicity, some of the most beautiful and complex fractals are just a simplistic pattern that 
is duplicated over and over. The interesting thig is these designs are very efficient and very prevalent in nature. These designs can be 
found in some vegetables, snowflakes, our cardiovascular system, electricity dispersion, and even river formations. In plants this design 
helps maximizes sunlight, in our own body it helps oxygen get transported though our bodies.

Here is a picture of electricity that was released and burned into plexiglass, it was explained as bottled lightening from the site I found 
this picture. There is a whole art form where people run electricity through wood between two pegs and it creates fractal art, I put a link down below.  

So, why do I find fractals so interesting? I am just about to finish my degree in computer programming and fractals remind me of the first 
time looking behind the scenes on some code for a program that seemed pretty simple. This approach is like being thrown into the middle of 
the ocean to learn how to swim. It just isnâ€™t feasible. When I was learning programming, I took in small bits at a time and grew that 
knowledge. I think this is a great approach to learning many different things in the world around us. Take a tree for example, a tree may 
look like one big solid object but when you look closer it is comprised of many different cells working together and getting instructions 
from its DNA. When you want to learn more about a tree or any complicated structure you need to break it down and look at the individual 
pieces and see why one-part sprouts branches and one leaves and so on. The world is an amazing place and only when you truly break it down 
can you understand how it really works. Maybe that is why I love math so much.
