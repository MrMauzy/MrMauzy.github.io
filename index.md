Welcome, my name is Matt Mauzy, well not really, I am just a webpage, but you get the point. Currently I have a Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Analytics, Bachelors in Computer Science, Minor in Applied Mathematics and have been in the IT field for about 7 years. In those 7 years I started on a help desk fixing computer software issues, then went into software development and from there I am working on a data warehouse team doing ETL work in SQL. If you would like you could check out some of my projects that I have worked on in my [projects]( https://mrmauzy.github.io/projects/) tab click here. I am currently working on updating this with my current data science projects so stay tuned!

I enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies, which is what brought me into the world of data science. I pride myself on being a life-long learner and hope to continue growing and learning in this ever-changing field. I fell in love with data science and I hope you stick around to see what I have made.

### What are you looking at? 

Laid out before you I have the culmination of my experience gained from my degree program, hobbies and things I have picked up during my career. Currently I am working as a computer programmer doing data warehouse ETL for an insurance company which holds high standards in its products, and highly regards exceptional team work. I work on a team of 5, and we are in charge of pulling and cleaning data for all of our lines of business. We work closely with one another in order to accomplish this goal through high levels of collaboration in a team environment, all the while communicating our progress to the stakeholders throughout our process.    

## Blog  

When I started down my path of becoming a software developer I had no idea what I was in for. I decided to start a blog, because there was no end to the topics that interest me, I love researching and putting what I learned into words. If you find interest in computer science, math or other random topics, please check out my blog with the link below!
