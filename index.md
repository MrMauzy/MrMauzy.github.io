<h1 align="center">Hello</h1>  

Welcome, my name is Matt Mauzy, I am a reliable and highly detailed-oriented individual who wants to further my career in software engineering. I am a Computer Science Graduate, with a minor in Applied Mathematics, as well as an Associate's degree in computer networking, and 7 years’ experience in the IT field.  

While working on my degree I have worked jobs ranging from hardware/software repair to systems monitoring in a fully automated warehouse.  I love creating art from 3D Animation to hand drawing cartoons, there is also a special place in my heart for one of my favorite topics, mathematics.  

I enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies, which is what brought me into the field of computer science. I pride myself on being a life-long learner and hope to continue growing and learning in this ever-changing field. I fell in love with software engineering and I hope you stick around to see what I have made. This isn’t just a career choice for me, it is (truly) my passion.

### What are you looking at? 

Laid out before you I have the culmination of my experience gained from my degree program, hobbies and things I have picked up during my career. Currently I am working as a computer programmer for an insurance company which holds high standards in its products, and highly regards exceptional team work. I work on a team of 5, and we are in charge of home and auto rate changes for the whole United States. We work closely with one another in order to accomplish this goal through high levels of collaboration in a team environment, all the while communicating our progress to the stakeholders throughout our process.    

Throughout my career, I have learned many interesting things from data structures, databases, algorithms, and security. But, I could talk about it all day and it wouldn’t mean anything. That is why I have a [portfolio]( https://mrmauzy.github.io/projects/) section on this site, to show you with code. This is where I will go in more depth about these projects, and hopefully show you the skills I have learned and continue to learn. I have picked out three artifacts to display and showcase my skills as a software developer. Please select a product down below for more information.  

## Weather Station  

This project uses a Raspberry Pi, Grove Pi, Python, JSON, HTML, JavaScript and different sensors to simulate a weather station that take humidity and temperature data. This program was designed to run with minimal interaction for long stretches of time in remote areas.  

## WPF RPG  

This was a project I picked up to help me learn C# with the help of a tutorial series I found online. The part of the program I am highlighting is the combat system I added to use magic spells that will in turn do damage to a creature and deplete your mana (or the cost of your spells.)  

## MongoDB Database  

This is a basic database program that uses MongoDB and python to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) a predefined database.  

## Blog  

When I started down my path of becoming a software developer I had no idea what I was in for. I decided to start a blog, because there was no end to the topics that interest me, I love researching and putting what I learned into words. If you find interest in computer science, math or other random topics, please check out my blog!
