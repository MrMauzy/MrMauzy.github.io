Welcome, my name is Matt Mauzy, I am a reliable and highly detailed-oriented individual who loves software engineering. I am a Computer Science Graduate, with a minor in Applied Mathematics and 7 yearsâ€™ experience in the IT field.  

While working on my degree I have worked jobs ranging from hardware/software repair to systems monitoring in a fully automated warehouse.  I love art, creating and consuming. I dabble in cartoon drawing, which can be seen in some of the projects I has listed in my [projects]( https://mrmauzy.github.io/projects/) tab. 

I enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies, which is what brought me into the world of computer science. I pride myself on being a life-long learner and hope to continue growing and learning in this ever-changing field. I fell in love with software engineering and I hope you stick around to see what I have made.

### What are you looking at? 

Laid out before you I have the culmination of my experience gained from my degree program, hobbies and things I have picked up during my career. Currently I am working as a computer programmer for an insurance company which holds high standards in its products, and highly regards exceptional team work. I work on a team of 4, and we are in charge of home and auto rate changes for the whole United States. We work closely with one another in order to accomplish this goal through high levels of collaboration in a team environment, all the while communicating our progress to the stakeholders throughout our process.    

## Blog  

When I started down my path of becoming a software developer I had no idea what I was in for. I decided to start a blog, because there was no end to the topics that interest me, I love researching and putting what I learned into words. If you find interest in computer science, math or other random topics, please check out my blog witht he link below!
