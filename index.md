## Welcome, my name is Matt Mauzy, I am a reliable and highly detailed-oriented individual that wants to further my career in software engineering. I am a Computer Science Graduate, with a minor in Applied Mathematics, and an associate degree in computer networking with at least 7 years’ experience in the IT field.  
## While working on my degree I have worked jobs from hardware/software repair to systems monitoring in a fully automated warehouse.  I love creating art from 3D Animation to hand drawing cartoons, there is also a special place in my heart for one of my favorite topics, mathematics.  
## I enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies and that is what brought me into the field of computer science. I pride myself on being a life-long learner and continue to grow and learn in this ever-changing field. I fell in love with software engineering and I hope you stick around and see what I have made. This isn’t just a career choice for me, it is a passion.

### What are you looking at? 

Laid out before you I have the culmination of my experience gained from my degree program, hobbies and things I have picked up in my career. Currently I am working as a computer programmer for an insurance company that holds high standards in its products and highly regards exceptional team work. I work on a team of 5 that is charge of home and auto rate changes for the whole United States. We work closely to accomplish this goal through high levels of collaboration in a team environment while communicating our progress to the stakeholders throughout our progress.

## Weather Station  

This project uses a Raspberry Pi, Grove Pi, Python, JSON, HTML, JavaScript and different sensors to simulate a weather station that take humidity and temperature data. This program was designed to run with minimal interaction for long stretches of time in remote areas.  

## WPF RPG  

This was a project I picked up to help me learn C# with the help of a tutorial series I found online. The part of the program I am highlighting is the combat system I added to use magic spells that will in turn do damage to a creature and deplete your mana (or the cost of your spells.)  

## MongoDB Database  

This is a basic database program that uses MongoDB and python to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) a predefined database.  

## Blog  

When I started down my path of becoming a software developer I had no idea what I was in for. I decided to start a blog since there was no end to the topics that interest me, and I love researching and putting what I learned into words. If you find computer science, math or other random topics, please check out my blog!
